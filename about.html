          <td>Alright, I'm not very good at it (still stuck in USACO Bronze), but I enjoy competitive coding because it feels like I'm doing something substancial and it feels nice getting my code to complete all test cases.</td>
          <td>This is sorta an extension of me playing FIFA. I never really played soccer, so I enjoy it through watching games. I root for Real Madrid and Manchester United, but I always love an underdog story (Qarabag FK in the Europa League was my favorite).</td>
