     <p class="defaultpara">Quizbowl is inherently supposed to be an easy-to-play, accessible game. Who doesn't love watching Jeopardy! on their TV, doing trivia nights with their family and friends, taking the knowledge that they've learned over the years and beating everyone else to the buzzer? However, quizbowl at the younger level, especially the high school level, is a lot harder... I, for one, have not played or practiced with a buzzer except at a singular in-person competition, and even then, some rounds were played with online buzzer solutions. I'm not saying that online solutions are bad, in fact it's what allows online competitions to occur, letting people qualify from regions without many local events. However, relying solely on online solutions sucks away some of the spirit of the competition. WHen entry-level buzzers are priced at $250, and high-end buzzers go for upwards of $1000, you'd expect them to be state-of-the-art and highly user-friendly, but in reality they're insanely difficult to repair and offer no real benefits, simply priced high due to a lack of competition.</p>
    <p class="defaultpara">This is expected to release around late September (depending on funding).</p>
